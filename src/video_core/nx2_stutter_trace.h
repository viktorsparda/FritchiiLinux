// EDEN_NX2_STUTTER_TRACE=1: per presented frame, the wall time each GPU thread (front, back,
// VulkanWorker) spent by category, from the EDEN_NX2_GPU_PROFILE zones (nx2_profile.h maps each
// zone to a category). Frames presented more than 33 ms after the previous one are logged with
// their top category (Nx2Stutter); every 10 s the frame-time histogram, pipeline builds and
// lookups (Nx2StutterSummary); and the boot phases with the process memory (Nx2Boot).
// tools/nx2/cache_metrics.py reads them. Frames longer than EDEN_NX2_STUTTER_DETAIL_MS (default
// 50) also get an Nx2StutterDetail line: each thread's largest zones and the sites below that ran.

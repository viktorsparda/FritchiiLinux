/// A draw that follows a draw of the same pipeline with only light state changes in between takes
/// the delta path. It keeps the previous draw's pipeline, image views, samplers and texture buffer
/// bindings, and resolves and binds every buffer (index, vertex, uniform, storage, texture) again
/// as a full resolve does, so guest memory written without a notification is streamed as in a
/// full resolve.
/// Light changes are draw parameters, index buffer and vertex stream registers, constant buffer
/// binds and inline constant buffer data (collected in g_delta: the rasterizer resolves in full
/// when they reach the pipeline's texture handles at their GPU addresses or through another
/// mapping of their device memory). Anything else that could change what a resolve produces bumps
/// a serial: a 3D register that changes, any 3D method with side effects (uploads, reports,
/// clears, barriers, ...), constant buffer data reaching the texture or sampler headers (the same
/// way), any other engine, deferred calls on the split's back (except the ones marked
/// GpuSplit::FastDrawNeutral), GPU::TickWork requests, texture cache writes, unmaps and
/// deletions, shader removals, fence releases, HLE macros and frames. The rasterizer takes the
/// delta path only while the serial, the GPU memory map, the command buffer, the render pass and
/// the bound pipeline are the ones the previous draw left.
/// EDEN_NX2_FAST_DRAW_VERIFY=1 resolves those draws in full and counts where the pipeline, views,
/// samplers or kept buffer bindings differ.
